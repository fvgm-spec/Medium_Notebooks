- Dataframe descriptive table

The following formulas should compute basic statistics on the integer columns of the dataset:

count
ArrayFormula(MAX((dataframe![column_range]<>"")*(ROW(dataframe![column_range]))))

mean
AVERAGE(dataframe![column_range])

standard deviation
STDEV(dataframe![column_range])

min value
MIN(dataframe![column_range])

1st quartile
QUARTILE(dataframe![column_range],1)

2nd quartile
QUARTILE(dataframe![column_range],2)

3rd quartile
QUARTILE(dataframe![column_range],3)

max value
MAX(dataframe![column_range])

The column ranges corresponds to the columns were are the integer values, if is the column A (age column), the range of the formula must be A:A

- Queries

How is distributed the capital gain per range of ages?
QUERY(dataframe![dataframe_range],"select B,sum(L) group by B order by sum(L) desc",1)

How many there are by workclass?
QUERY(dataframe![dataframe_range],"select C,count(A) group by C order by count(A) desc",1)

Which are the top occupations by workclass?
QUERY(dataframe![dataframe_range],"select H,C,count(A) where C='Private' group by H,C order by count(A) desc",1)

Which is the sex with more capital gain?
QUERY(dataframe![dataframe_range],"select K,sum(L) group by K order by sum(L) desc",1)

Which is the most profitable education status?
QUERY(dataframe![dataframe_range],"select E,sum(L) group by E order by sum(L) desc",1)
